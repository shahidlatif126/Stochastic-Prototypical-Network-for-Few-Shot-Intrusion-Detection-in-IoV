**Utilized Dataset X-CANIDS** <br>
In the proposed framework, we used X-CANIDS dataset. It can be accessed from IEEE Dataport. <br>
[X-CANIDS Dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/x-canids-dataset-vehicle-signal-dataset) <br>

A detailed description of the dataset is available in the article.
[X-CANIDS: Signal-Aware Explainable Intrusion Detection System for Controller Area Network-Based In-Vehicle Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294210) <br>

The preprocessed version of X-CANIDS Dataset can be accessed from Google Drive. <br>
